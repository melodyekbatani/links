<!-- I'm not entierly sure about the vibe I want for this site yet, right now it's feeling kind of bland :/ In understanding Trenton's taste in R&B music, it seems like he's drawn to more current eras of R&B (2017-2026)but I wanted this site to be a reflection on the aesthetics of the genre, the style associated with it, and the design around it, primarly through album covers. After creating this, I realized the old Ipod interface might be interesting as a starting point, or even intergrating parts of the limewire ui. Would love to hear any thoughts you have on the design as well! -->

I think I understand the basic premise of this, the controls allow for users to click and interact with this, although I would like to make this more interegrated in this project. Then they call the audio file saved in the Blocks folder, letting the browser know what kind of media to display -->
