            <p>Each medium carries its own traditions and ways of practice. R&B, or Rhythm and Blues, originated in African American communities in the 1940s. It combines elements of jazz, gospel, and blues, and is characterized by its soulful vocals, strong rhythms, and often romantic themes and continues to be a significant and influential genre in the music industry today. In R&B these traditions emerge through sound, image, and feeling. This compilation traces defining moments, highlighting the artistry of the medium while exploring identity, intimacy, and image-making within its visual culture.</p>

                    <h3> Trenton(curator)</h3>
                    <p>This collection explores my subjective relationship to contemporary R&B music through sound,
                        image, and context. Bringing together album cover art, criticism, and artist references, this
                        collection reflects on what it means to make R&B music today. It explores how visuals shape the
                        listening experience, how genre labels influence how music is understood, and how artists
                        balance intimacy, expression, and expectation.</p>

                    <h3> Melody(designer & developer)</h3>
                    <p>My name is Melody, though I may be the least musical person you'll ever meet. Just ask my former
                        piano, flute, violin, or guitar teachers (my parents really wanted it to work out).</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I was introduced to Trent's admittedly awesome collection, which helped me
                        understand why I felt disconnected in the first place. I began to wonder if I could not
                        participate through performance, maybe there were other ways to pay attention. This website
                        looks closely at the art, visual culture, and expression of R&B, a deeply human genre shaped by
                        the stories and cultural moments it carries. So maybe this is the way I find myself through
                        music. Anyways, I really enjoyed making this, I hope you like it too.</p>
